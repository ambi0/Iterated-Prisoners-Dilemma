### To Compile and Execute

```sh
$ gcc -o genetic genetic.c
$ ./genetic < input.txt
```

### Input Structure
GA - Genetic Algorithm
IPD - Iterated Prisoner's Dilemma
The last six parameters of the input line below are the fitness weights for each heuristic.
Each line consists of a simulation of the format:
```sh
[Population Size] [GA Iterations] [IPD Iterations] [Selection Rate] [Mutation Rate] [IPD Score] [Diversity] [Niceness] [Forgiveness] [Retaliation] [Non-Enviousness]
```
